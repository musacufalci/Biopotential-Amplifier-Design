# Biopotential Amplifier Design

- The value of the detected signal at 1-1.5 mv level was increased to 500 mv levels.
- Features: Linear Amplifiers, Voltage Supply, Single/Dual (±): ±6V ~ 18V, Current Supply: 3.5mA, Operating Temperature: -25°C ~ 85°C, Gain Bandwidth Product: 25MHz, Pin Programmable Gains: 1, 100, 200, 500, Slew Rate: 5V/µs, -3db Bandwidth: 1MHz, Current - Input Bias: 50nA, Voltage - Input Offset: 200µV...
- The human body produces electrical signals of the order of µV during normal operation. In order for these signals to be used in devices such as ECG, EEG, bedside monitors and defibrillators, they must first be amplified at the desired level...
